# Best Practices for Forge

This document outlines recommended best practices for maximizing productivity, security, and effectiveness when working with Forge. Following these guidelines will help you develop an efficient workflow and avoid common pitfalls.

## Task Formulation

### Specificity and Context

The quality of responses from Forge directly correlates with the specificity and context provided in your task descriptions:

```bash
# Ineffective: too vague
forge "Fix the code"

# Effective: specific with context
forge "Fix the null pointer exception in auth_service.js when handling expired tokens"
```

### Include Relevant Constraints

Specify any constraints or requirements that are important for your task:

```bash
# With specific constraints
forge "Optimize the database query in user_repository.js to reduce execution time, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing API contracts"
```

### Staged Approach for Complex Tasks

Break down complex tasks into logical stages:

1. **Analysis**: First, understand the problem thoroughly
   ```bash
   forge "Analyze the performance bottleneck in the image processing pipeline and identify the primary causes"
   ```

2. **Planning**: Develop a structured approach
   ```bash
   forge "Based on the identified bottlenecks, develop a strategy for optimizing the image processing pipeline"
   ```

3. **Implementation**: Execute the plan with specific changes
   ```bash
   forge "Implement the async processing approach we discussed for the image pipeline, focusing first on the resize operation"
   ```

## Mode Selection Strategy

### Appropriate Use of ACT Mode

Use ACT mode (default) when:

- Working in development environments with version control
- Implementing changes to non-critical systems
- Performing routine tasks with limited scope
- Making changes that are easily reversible

```bash
# Explicitly activate ACT mode if needed
/act
```

### Appropriate Use of PLAN Mode

Use PLAN mode when:

- Working with critical production systems
- Making architectural decisions that require careful consideration
- Evaluating multiple possible approaches before implementation
- Needing documentation of planned changes for team review

```bash
# Switch to PLAN mode for analysis without changes
/plan
```

### Hybrid Approach

For complex projects, consider a hybrid approach:

1. Start with PLAN mode to analyze and strategize
2. Switch to ACT mode for incremental implementation
3. Return to PLAN mode to validate and prepare subsequent changes

## Security Considerations

### Environment-Specific Security

Adjust security settings based on your environment:

- **Development**: Standard mode with version control is typically sufficient
- **Testing/Staging**: Consider restricted mode based on system sensitivity
- **Production**: Always use restricted mode and additional safeguards

### Sensitive Information Handling

- Never include API keys, passwords, or sensitive tokens in your tasks
- Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- Be cautious when working in directories containing sensitive configuration files

### Before Running Destructive Operations

When Forge proposes potentially destructive operations:

1. Review the commands thoroughly before execution
2. Ensure you have proper backups or version control
3. Consider running a dry-run version of the command when available
4. Verify the scope of impact matches your expectations

## Workflow Integration

### Version Control Integration

Always integrate Forge with your version control workflow:

```bash
# Before starting work with Forge
git checkout -b feature/new-auth-flow

# After making changes with Forge
git diff # Review changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Implement new authentication flow with Forge assistance"
```

### Code Review Preparation

Prepare code for review by documenting AI assistance:

```bash
# Ask Forge to document its changes
forge "Summarize the changes you've made to the authentication flow and explain key design decisions"
```

### Continuous Integration

When using Forge in projects with CI/CD:

1. Run local tests before pushing changes
2. Ask Forge to validate changes against CI requirements
3. Address any test failures before submission

```bash
# Validate against tests
forge "Fix any issues that might cause the unit tests to fail for the authentication service"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Model Selection

Choose the appropriate model based on task complexity:

- Use lightweight models for simple tasks (e.g., formatting, documentation)
- Reserve powerful models for complex reasoning and code generation

### Context Management

Manage context effectively to improve performance:

- Use `/new` between unrelated tasks
- Provide focused context instead of entire codebases
- Use targeted search with `grep` or `find` and pipe results to Forge

```bash
# Find relevant code and pass directly to Forge
grep -r "handleAuthentication" --include="*.js" . | forge "Identify potential security issues in these authentication handlers"
```

### Local Processing When Appropriate

For simple text processing tasks, consider traditional tools:

```bash
# Use local tools for straightforward tasks
find . -name "*.js" -exec sed -i 's/console.log/logger.debug/g' {} \;

# Use Forge for tasks requiring intelligence
forge "Identify and fix inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase"
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### When Forge Produces Unexpected Results

If Forge provides unexpected or incorrect results:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Make your task more specific
2. **Provide Examples**: Show examples of expected output
3. **Break Down Tasks**: Split complex tasks into smaller steps

### Using Logs Effectively

Reference logs to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# View recent logs with jq for better formatting
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/forge/logs/forge.log.$(date +%Y-%m-%d) | jq
```

### Iterative Refinement

Use an iterative approach to guide Forge toward better solutions:

```bash
# Initial request
forge "Create an API endpoint for user registration"

# Refinement
forge "The endpoint looks good, but we need to add input validation and rate limiting"

# Further refinement
forge "Great, now add unit tests for the validation logic"
```

## Project Organization

### Repository-Specific Configurations

Create project-specific configurations for repeat tasks:

1. Create a `forge.yaml` file in your project root
2. Configure specialized agents for common project tasks
3. Customize model selection based on project needs

### Documentation Integration

Integrate Forge into your documentation workflow:

```bash
# Generate API documentation
forge "Generate OpenAPI documentation for the user management endpoints in src/api/users.js"

# Update README with new features
forge "Update the README.md to include documentation for the new authentication flow"
```

### Knowledge Preservation

Preserve valuable solutions for reuse:

```bash
# Save a complex solution for future reference
forge "Explain the caching strategy we implemented for the product catalog" 
/dump
```

## Collaborative Development

### Sharing Forge Outputs

When sharing Forge outputs with team members:

1. Include the original prompt for context
2. Document any manual modifications to the generated content
3. Note any assumptions or constraints that influenced the solution

### Team Standards

Establish team standards for Forge usage:

- Define when to use PLAN vs ACT mode
- Create shared prompt templates for common tasks
- Document best practices specific to your codebase

### Pairing with Forge

Consider using Forge in pair programming sessions:

- One developer focuses on requirements and review
- Forge assists with implementation details
- Second developer guides and refines the approach

## Domain-Specific Best Practices

### Web Development

For web development projects:

- Request cross-browser compatibility considerations
- Ask for accessibility compliance when creating UI components
- Ensure responsive design is addressed in frontend tasks

### Backend Development

For backend systems:

- Explicitly request error handling for all edge cases
- Ask for performance considerations for database operations
- Request security review for authentication/authorization logic

### DevOps Tasks

When using Forge for infrastructure:

- Always request idempotent operations
- Ask for cleanup steps for any provisioned resources
- Request validation steps before any destructive operations

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Forge

Forge can be a learning tool as well as a productivity tool:

```bash
# Ask for explanations of generated code
forge "Explain the design pattern you used in the authentication service and why it's appropriate for this use case"
```

### Feedback Loop

Establish a feedback loop to improve your use of Forge:

1. Document particularly effective or ineffective prompts
2. Review generated code to understand patterns and approaches
3. Refine your interaction style based on results

### Keeping Current

Stay updated on Forge capabilities:

- Check for Forge updates regularly
- Review new features and models in the documentation
- Experiment with new capabilities in non-critical environments
