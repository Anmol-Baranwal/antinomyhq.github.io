# Built-in Commands

Forge provides a suite of built-in commands that enhance workflow efficiency and provide system control. These commands are prefixed with a forward slash (`/`) to differentiate them from standard input queries and task descriptions.

## Available Commands

| Command   | Description               | When to Use                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/new`    | Start a new task          | When you've completed your current task and want to begin a fresh conversation           |
| `/info`   | View environment summary  | When you need to check your environment configuration, logs location, or command history |
| `/models` | List available AI models  | When you want to see which AI models are available and their capabilities                |
| `/dump`   | Save conversation to JSON | When you want to save the current conversation for reference or sharing                  |
| `/act`    | Switch to ACT mode        | When you want Forge to execute commands and implement changes (this is the default mode) |
| `/plan`   | Switch to PLAN mode       | When you want Forge to analyze and plan but not modify files                             |
| `/help`   | Display help information  | When you need a reminder of available commands                                           |

## Command Details

### `/new`

The `/new` command clears the current conversation context and starts a fresh task. This is useful when you've completed your current task and want to begin something entirely different.

```bash
/new
```

**When to use**: Use this when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure a clean context.

### `/info`

The `/info` command displays information about your environment, including system details, logs location, and command history.

```bash
/info
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need to troubleshoot, find log files, or review your recent commands.

### `/models`

The `/models` command lists all available AI models with their capabilities and context limitations.

```bash
/models
```

**Example output**:

```
Available models:
- anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (Context: 200K tokens)
- anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku (Context: 200K tokens)
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to check which models are available or understand their capabilities.

### `/dump`

The `/dump` command saves the current conversation in JSON format to a file for future reference.

```bash
/dump
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to save a particularly useful conversation for documentation, sharing, or reference.

### `/act`

The `/act` command switches Forge to ACT mode, where it can execute commands and implement changes.

```bash
/act
```

**When to use**: This is the default mode. Use this command to switch back to ACT mode if you were previously in PLAN mode.

### `/plan`

The `/plan` command switches Forge to PLAN mode, where it analyzes and suggests changes without modifying files.

```bash
/plan
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want Forge to analyze your codebase and suggest changes without actually implementing them. This is useful for understanding what would happen before making changes.

### `/help`

The `/help` command displays information about available commands and their usage.

```bash
/help
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need a quick reminder of the available commands and their functions.

## Best Practices

- **Start Fresh**: Use `/new` when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure the context is clean.
- **Preserve Knowledge**: Use `/dump` to save valuable conversations that you might want to reference later.
- **Understand Before Acting**: Use `/plan` to see what actions Forge would take before allowing it to make changes.
- **Check System Status**: Use `/info` when something isn't working as expected to diagnose potential issues.
- **Select Appropriate Models**: Use `/models` to understand which model is best for your specific task.
