# Built-in Commands

Forge offers several built-in commands to enhance your interaction. These commands can be entered directly in the Forge CLI by typing the command name preceded by a forward slash.

## Available Commands

### /new

Start a new task when you've completed your current one.

The `/new` command clears the current conversation context and starts a fresh task. This is useful when you've completed your current task and want to begin something entirely different.

**When to use:** Use this when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure a clean context.

### /info

View environment summary, logs folder location, and command history.

The `/info` command displays information about your environment, including system details, logs location, and command history.

This will display information about your environment including:

- Operating system details
- Current working directory
- Log file location
- Application version
- Available models

**When to use:** Use this when you need to troubleshoot, find log files, or review your recent commands.

### /model

Select and set a specific model in your forge.yaml configuration.

The `/model` command allows you to interactively select from available AI models and set your preferred model in the project's forge.yaml configuration file.

This will:

1. Display an interactive selection menu with all available models
2. Update the standard_model anchor in your forge.yaml file with your selection
3. Confirm the change with a success message

The model choice will persist between sessions as it's stored in your configuration file.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to change which AI model Forge uses for processing your requests.

### /agent

Select and switch between available agents.

The `/agent` command provides an interactive interface to select and switch between different specialized agents in Forge.

This will:

1. Display an interactive selection menu with available agents:

   - **Forge Agent**: Full execution capabilities with read-write access
   - **Muse Agent**: Read-only analysis and planning mode

2. Switch to the selected agent for the current session

**When to use:** Use this when you want to switch between agents or when you're unsure which agent is currently active. This is an alternative to using the specific `/forge` or `/muse` commands.

### /dump

Save the current conversation in JSON format to a file for reference.

The `/dump` command saves the current conversation in JSON format to a file for future reference.

**When to use:** Use this when you need to debug issues, inspect the conversation context, or report problems to the development team.

### /forge

Switch to Forge Agent (default), where it can execute commands and implement changes.

The `/forge` command switches to Forge Agent, where it can execute commands and implement changes.

**When to use:** This is the default agent. Use this command to switch back to the Forge Agent if you were previously using the Muse Agent.

### /muse

Switch to Muse Agent, where it analyzes and plans but doesn't modify files.

The `/muse` command switches to the Muse Agent, where it analyzes and suggests changes without modifying files.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to analyze your codebase and suggest changes without actually implementing them. This is useful for understanding what would happen before making changes.

## Native Shell Commands

Forge allows you to execute native shell commands directly from the CLI by prefixing them with `!`:

```
!ls -la
!git status
!npm install
```

These commands will be executed in your current working directory, and their output will be displayed in the console.

## Usage Examples

To use any of these commands, simply type them in the Forge CLI:

```
/info
```

For native shell commands, prefix with `!`:

```
!git status
```
