# Custom Workflows & Multi-Agent Systems

For complex tasks, a single agent may not be sufficient. Forge allows you to create custom workflows with multiple specialized agents working together to accomplish sophisticated tasks.

## Multi-Agent Architecture Overview

Forge implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that enables specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks. This distributed approach to problem-solving provides several technical advantages:

- **Specialization**: Agents can focus on specific tasks they excel at
- **Efficiency**: Smaller models can handle simpler tasks, saving resources
- **Parallelization**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem
- **Collaboration**: Agents can share information and build upon each other's work

## Creating Custom Workflows

You can configure your own workflows by creating a YAML file and pointing to it with the `-w` flag:

```bash
forge -w /path/to/your/workflow.yaml
```

### Configuration Loading and Precedence

Forge loads workflow configurations using the following precedence rules:

1. **Explicit Path**: When a path is provided with the `-w` flag, Forge loads that configuration directly without any merging
2. **Project Configuration**: If no explicit path is provided, Forge looks for `forge.yaml` in the current directory
3. **Default Configuration**: An embedded default configuration is always available as a fallback

When a project configuration exists in the current directory, Forge creates a merged configuration where:

- Project settings in `forge.yaml` take precedence over default settings
- Any settings not specified in the project configuration inherit from defaults

This approach allows you to customize only the parts of the configuration you need while inheriting sensible defaults for everything else.

## Workflow Configuration Structure

A workflow consists of agents connected via events. Each agent has specific capabilities and can perform designated tasks.

### Event System

Agents communicate through events which they can publish and subscribe to:

#### Built-in Events

- `user_task_init` - Published when a new task is initiated
- `user_task_update` - Published when follow-up instructions are provided by the user

### Agent Tools

Each agent needs tools to perform tasks, configured in the `tools` field:

#### Built-in Tools

- `tool_forge_fs_read` - Read from the filesystem
- `tool_forge_fs_create` - Create or overwrite files
- `tool_forge_fs_remove` - Remove files
- `tool_forge_fs_search` - Search for patterns in files
- `tool_forge_fs_list` - List files in a directory
- `tool_forge_fs_info` - Get file metadata
- `tool_forge_process_shell` - Execute shell commands
- `tool_forge_process_think` - Perform internal reasoning
- `tool_forge_net_fetch` - Fetch data from the internet
- `tool_forge_event_dispatch` - Dispatch events to other agents
- `tool_forge_fs_patch` - Patch existing files

### Agent Configuration Options

- `id` - Unique identifier for the agent
- `model` - AI model to use (from the `\models` list)
- `tools` - List of tools the agent can use
- `subscribe` - Events the agent listens to
- `ephemeral` - If true, agent is destroyed after task completion
- `tool_supported` - (Optional) Boolean flag that determines whether tools defined in the agent configuration are actually made available to the LLM
- `system_prompt` - (Optional) Instructions for how the agent should behave
- `user_prompt` - (Optional) Format for user inputs

### Built-in Templates

Forge provides templates to simplify system prompt creation:

- `system-prompt-engineer.hbs` - Template for engineering tasks
- `system-prompt-title-generator.hbs` - Template for generating descriptive titles
- `system-prompt-advocate.hbs` - Template for user advocacy and explanation
- `partial-tool-information.hbs` - Tool documentation for agents
- `partial-tool-examples.hbs` - Usage examples for tools

Use these templates with the syntax: `{{> name-of-the-template.hbs }}`

## Example Workflow Configuration

```yaml
variables:
  models:
    advanced_model: &advanced_model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
    efficiency_model: &efficiency_model anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku

agents:
  - id: title_generation_worker
    model: *efficiency_model
    tools:
      - tool_forge_event_dispatch
    subscribe:
      - user_task_init
    tool_supported: false # Force XML-based tool call formatting
    system_prompt: "{{> system-prompt-title-generator.hbs }}"
    user_prompt: <technical_content>{{event.value}}</technical_content>

  - id: developer
    model: *advanced_model
    tools:
      - tool_forge_fs_read
      - tool_forge_fs_create
      - tool_forge_fs_remove
      - tool_forge_fs_patch
      - tool_forge_process_shell
      - tool_forge_net_fetch
      - tool_forge_fs_search
    subscribe:
      - user_task_init
      - user_task_update
    ephemeral: false
    tool_supported: true # Use model's native tool call format (default)
    system_prompt: "{{> system-prompt-engineer.hbs }}"
    user_prompt: |
      <task>{{event.value}}</task>
```

This example workflow creates two agents:

1. A title generation worker that creates meaningful titles for user conversations
2. A developer agent that can perform comprehensive file and system operations
