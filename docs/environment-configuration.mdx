# Environment Configuration

Forge can be configured through environment variables to control its behavior, API connections, and model preferences. This page describes the available configuration options and how to use them.

## Configuration Methods

You can configure Forge using either:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set directly in your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)
2. **`.env` File**: Create a file named `.env` in your home directory

The `.env` file method is recommended for most users as it keeps your configuration in one place and prevents exposing API keys in your shell history.

## API Provider Configuration

### API Keys

Forge supports multiple AI providers and checks for API keys in the following priority order:

| Environment Variable | Provider                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `FORGE_KEY`          | Antinomy's provider (OpenAI-compatible)  |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Open Router (aggregates multiple models) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Official OpenAI                          |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | Official Anthropic                       |

Example configuration in `.env` file:

```bash
# For Open Router (recommended, provides access to multiple models)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# For official OpenAI
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# For official Anthropic
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# For Antinomy's provider
# FORGE_KEY=your_forge_key_here
```

### Custom Provider URLs

For OpenAI-compatible providers (including Open Router), you can customize the API endpoint URL:

```bash
# Custom OpenAI-compatible provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_URL=https://your-custom-provider.com/v1

# Or with Open Router but custom endpoint
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
OPENAI_URL=https://alternative-openrouter-endpoint.com/v1
```

This is useful for:

- Self-hosted models with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Enterprise OpenAI deployments
- Proxy services or API gateways
- Regional API endpoints
