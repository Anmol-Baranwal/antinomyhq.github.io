# Getting Started with Forge

## Installation

### Mac

Using Homebrew (macOS package manager):

```bash
# Add Code-Forge's package repository to Homebrew
brew tap antinomyhq/code-forge

# Install Code-Forge
brew install code-forge
```

### Linux

Choose either method to install:

```bash
# Using curl (common download tool)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash

# Or using wget (alternative download tool)
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Get Started

1. Create a `.env` file in your home directory with your API credentials:

```bash
# Your API key for accessing AI models (see Environment Configuration section)
OPEN_ROUTER_KEY=<Enter your Open Router Key>
```

2. Start an interactive shell by typing `forge`:

```bash
forge
âš¡ # Write your task here and press enter or type
```

For additional configuration options and features, use `forge --help`.

## Environment Configuration

Code-Forge can be configured through environment variables. You can set these in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or by creating a `.env` file in your home directory.

### API Keys

Code-Forge will look for API keys in the following order of precedence:

```bash
# Primary Forge API key (highest precedence)
FORGE_KEY=<your-forge-api-key>

# OpenRouter API key (used if FORGE_KEY is not set)
OPEN_ROUTER_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>

# OpenAI API key (used if FORGE_KEY and OPEN_ROUTER_KEY are not set)
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

# Anthropic API key (used if none of the above are set)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
```

At least one of these API keys must be set for Code-Forge to function properly.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Shell

Transform your command-line experience with natural language interaction while maintaining the power and flexibility of traditional shell commands.

**Example**:

Start the interactive shell with:

```bash
forge
```

### 2. Enhanced Security

Code-Forge prioritizes security by providing a restricted shell mode (rbash) that limits potentially dangerous operations:

- **Flexible Security Options**: Choose between standard and restricted modes based on your needs
- **Restricted Mode**: Enable with `-r` flag to prevent potentially harmful operations
- **Standard Mode**: Uses regular shell by default (bash on Unix/Mac, cmd on Windows)
- **Security Controls**: Restricted mode prevents:
  - Changing directories
  - Setting/modifying environment variables
  - Executing commands with absolute paths
  - Modifying shell options

**Example**:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
forge

# Restricted secure mode
forge -r
```

### 3. Model Flexibility

Optimize your workflow by choosing the right AI model for each task:

- **Quick Tasks**: Use lightweight models for rapid responses
- **Complex Operations**: Leverage more powerful models for in-depth analysis

**Configuration**:

```bash
export FORGE_LARGE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
export FORGE_SMALL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku
```

### 4. Autocomplete

Boost your productivity with intelligent command completion:

- Type `@` and press Tab for contextual file/path completion
- Use Right Arrow to complete previously executed commands
- Access command history with Up Arrow
- Quick history search with Ctrl+R

### 5. Custom Instructions

Tailor Code-Forge to your specific needs with custom instruction sets:

```bash
forge --custom-instructions path/to/instructions.yml
```

### 6. WYSIWYG Shell Integration

Enhance your interactive shell experience with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) integration. 'forge' now visualizes each command executed, complete with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal. This feature ensures clarity and enhances interaction, making every command visible in rich detail.

### 7. Command Interruption

Stay in control of your shell environment with intuitive command handling:

- **Cancel with `CTRL+C`:** Gracefully interrupt ongoing operations, providing the flexibility to halt processes that no longer need execution.
- **Exit with `CTRL+D`:** Easily exit the shell session without hassle, ensuring you can quickly terminate your operations when needed.
