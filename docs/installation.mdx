# Installing Forge

Forge can be installed on macOS and Linux operating systems. Follow the instructions for your platform below.

## macOS Installation

Using Homebrew (macOS package manager):

```bash
# Add Code-Forge's package repository to Homebrew
brew tap antinomyhq/code-forge

# Install Code-Forge
brew install code-forge
```

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by following the instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

## Linux Installation

Choose either of these methods to install Forge on Linux:

### Using curl

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Using wget

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Verifying Your Installation

After installation, verify that Forge is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
forge --version
```

You should see output displaying the version of Forge that you've installed.

## Updating Forge

To update Forge to the latest version:

### macOS

```bash
brew upgrade code-forge
```

### Linux

Run the same installation command again to get the latest version:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```
