# Application Logging

Forge generates detailed JSON-formatted logs that help with troubleshooting and understanding the application's behavior. These logs provide valuable insights into system operations and API interactions.

## Log Location and Access

Logs are stored in your application support directory with date-based filenames. The typical path looks like:

```bash
/Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.YYYY-MM-DD
```

You can easily locate log files using the built-in command `/info`, which displays system information including the exact path to your log files.

## Log Structure

Forge logs are structured in JSON format, making them easy to parse and analyze. Each log entry contains fields such as:

- **timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **level**: Log level (info, warn, error, debug)
- **message**: Description of the event
- **context**: Additional contextual information
- **requestId**: Identifier for API requests (when applicable)
- **duration**: Time taken for operations (when applicable)

Example log entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:32:18.567Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "API request completed",
  "context": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet",
    "promptTokens": 450,
    "completionTokens": 320,
    "totalTokens": 770
  },
  "requestId": "req_1a2b3c4d5e",
  "duration": 1250
}
```

## Viewing and Filtering Logs

### Basic Log Viewing

To view logs in real-time with automatic updates, use the `tail` command:

```bash
tail -f /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07
```

### Formatted Log Viewing with jq

Since Forge logs are in JSON format, you can pipe them through `jq` for better readability:

```bash
tail -f /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq
```

This displays the logs in a nicely color-coded structure that's much easier to analyze.

### Filtering Logs

You can use `jq` to filter logs for specific information:

```bash
# Find all error logs
cat /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.level == "error")'

# Find logs related to a specific request
cat /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.requestId == "req_1a2b3c4d5e")'

# Find file operations
cat /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.message | contains("file"))'
```

## Log Levels

Forge uses different log levels to categorize information:

- **debug**: Detailed debugging information
- **info**: General information about system operation
- **warn**: Warning conditions that don't cause errors
- **error**: Error conditions that affect operation

You can configure the log level in your environment variables:

```bash
# In your .env file
FORGE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Common Log Patterns

### API Interactions

Look for logs containing API request and response information to understand model interactions:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:32:10.123Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "API request started",
  "context": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
  },
  "requestId": "req_1a2b3c4d5e"
}
```

### File Operations

File operations are logged with details about paths and actions:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:32:20.456Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "File created",
  "context": {
    "path": "/Users/username/project/src/component.js",
    "bytes": 1024
  }
}
```

### Shell Commands

Shell command execution is logged with command details and results:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:32:30.789Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Shell command executed",
  "context": {
    "command": "git status",
    "workingDirectory": "/Users/username/project",
    "exitCode": 0
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting with Logs

### API Issues

If you're experiencing problems with AI responses:

1. Look for logs with level "error" and context related to API calls
2. Check for rate limiting or token quota issues
3. Verify API key validity in error messages

Example search:

```bash
cat forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.level == "error" and .message | contains("API"))'
```

### Performance Analysis

To analyze performance:

1. Look for logs with duration information
2. Identify operations that take longer than expected
3. Check for patterns in slow operations

Example search:

```bash
cat forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.duration > 2000) | {message, duration, timestamp}'
```

### File Operation Errors

For file operation issues:

1. Search for file-related error logs
2. Check for permission issues or missing paths
3. Verify file content details

Example search:

```bash
cat forge.log.2025-03-07 | jq 'select(.level == "error" and .message | contains("file"))'
```

## Log Management

### Log Rotation

Forge automatically rotates logs daily, creating new files with the current date. Old logs are retained but not actively written to.

### Storage Considerations

Log files can grow large with heavy usage. Consider periodically archiving or removing old logs to conserve disk space:

```bash
# Compress old logs to save space
gzip /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-02-*

# Or remove logs older than 30 days
find /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs -name "forge.log.*" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Log Archiving

For important sessions, you might want to archive logs:

```bash
# Copy today's log to a project-specific archive
cp /Users/username/Library/Application Support/forge/logs/forge.log.2025-03-07 ~/project-archives/refactoring-session.log
```
