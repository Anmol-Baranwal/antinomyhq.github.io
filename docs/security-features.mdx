# Security Features

Forge implements a comprehensive security model that includes a restricted shell mode and several protective mechanisms designed to safeguard your system while providing full functionality. This documentation details the security architecture and implementation strategies for various operational contexts.

## Restricted Shell Mode

Forge offers a restricted shell mode (rbash) that limits potentially dangerous operations:

### Enabling Restricted Mode

To enable the restricted secure mode, use the `-r` flag when starting Forge:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
forge

# Restricted secure mode
forge -r
```

### Security Controls in Restricted Mode

Restricted mode prevents several potentially risky operations:

- **Directory Navigation**: Cannot change directories
- **Environment Modification**: Cannot set or modify environment variables
- **Absolute Path Execution**: Cannot execute commands with absolute paths
- **Shell Option Modification**: Cannot modify shell options

These restrictions help prevent inadvertent or malicious actions that could affect your system beyond the current directory.

## Direct API Connections

Forge connects directly to AI providers without intermediate servers:

- **Local Processing**: All non-AI tasks are processed locally on your machine
- **Direct API Calls**: API calls go directly from your machine to the AI provider
- **No Intermediary Servers**: Your queries and responses don't pass through third-party servers
- **Data Privacy**: Your code and commands remain between your system and the AI provider

## Additional Security Measures

### Local Terminal Operation

Forge operates entirely within your local terminal:

- **Local Execution**: All commands execute locally on your machine
- **No Remote Code Execution**: No external servers can execute code on your system
- **Full Visibility**: You can see every command before it executes
- **Interrupt Capability**: You can interrupt any operation with Ctrl+C
