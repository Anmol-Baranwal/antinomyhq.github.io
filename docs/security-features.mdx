# Security Features

Forge implements a comprehensive security model that includes a restricted shell mode and several protective mechanisms designed to safeguard your system while providing full functionality. This documentation details the security architecture and implementation strategies for various operational contexts.

## Restricted Shell Mode

Forge offers a restricted shell mode (rbash) that limits potentially dangerous operations:

### Enabling Restricted Mode

To enable the restricted secure mode, use the `-r` flag when starting Forge:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
forge

# Restricted secure mode
forge -r
```

### Security Controls in Restricted Mode

Restricted mode prevents several potentially risky operations:

- **Directory Navigation**: Cannot change directories
- **Environment Modification**: Cannot set or modify environment variables
- **Absolute Path Execution**: Cannot execute commands with absolute paths
- **Shell Option Modification**: Cannot modify shell options

These restrictions help prevent inadvertent or malicious actions that could affect your system beyond the current directory.

## Direct API Connections

Forge connects directly to AI providers without intermediate servers:

- **Local Processing**: All non-AI tasks are processed locally on your machine
- **Direct API Calls**: API calls go directly from your machine to the AI provider
- **No Intermediary Servers**: Your queries and responses don't pass through third-party servers
- **Data Privacy**: Your code and commands remain between your system and the AI provider

## Additional Security Measures

### Local Terminal Operation

Forge operates entirely within your local terminal:

- **Local Execution**: All commands execute locally on your machine
- **No Remote Code Execution**: No external servers can execute code on your system
- **Full Visibility**: You can see every command before it executes
- **Interrupt Capability**: You can interrupt any operation with Ctrl+C

### Safe Defaults

Forge is designed with safe defaults to prevent accidental damage:

- **Standard Mode Constraints**: Even in standard mode, Forge has built-in safeguards
- **Confirmation for Risky Operations**: Destructive operations require confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents cascading failures

## Security Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Recommendations

#### Development Environments

In development environments, you might prefer convenience:

```bash
# Use standard mode for development
forge
```

#### Production or Critical Environments

For production or critical systems, prioritize security:

```bash
# Use restricted mode for production systems
forge -r
```

### Task-Specific Security

Adjust your security based on the task:

- **Code Analysis**: Use restricted mode when only analyzing code
- **System Exploration**: Use restricted mode when exploring unfamiliar systems
- **Trusted Repositories**: Standard mode may be appropriate for trusted repositories

### Additional Safeguards

To further enhance security:

1. **Version Control**: Always use version control and commit before significant changes
2. **Isolated Environments**: Use containers or VMs for testing unknown code
3. **Regular Backups**: Maintain backups of critical systems
4. **Least Privilege**: Run Forge with the minimum permissions needed
5. **Separate API Keys**: Use different API keys for different environments

## Security FAQ

### Is it safe to use Forge on my main development machine?

Yes, Forge is designed for safety, especially when using restricted mode. It doesn't execute any commands without your input and control.

### Can Forge execute commands without showing me?

No, Forge always shows commands before execution, giving you visibility into all operations.

### How does restricted mode differ from standard mode?

Restricted mode adds additional constraints to prevent potentially dangerous operations like changing directories or using absolute paths.

### Does Forge send my code to third-party servers?

Forge only sends the content required for AI processing to your configured AI provider. No code is sent to any other third-party servers.

### Can I use Forge in a corporate environment with strict security?

Yes, but you should:
1. Get approval from your security team
2. Use restricted mode
3. Consider using a self-hosted model or enterprise AI provider
4. Follow your organization's data handling policies
