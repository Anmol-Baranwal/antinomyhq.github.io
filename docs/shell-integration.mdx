# Shell Integration Features

Forge provides several features that enhance your shell experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. This section covers key shell integration features including autocomplete, WYSIWYG shell experience, and command interruption.

## Autocomplete

Boost your productivity with Forge's intelligent command completion features:

### File and Path Completion

Type `@` followed by a partial path and press Tab to get contextual file/path completion:

```bash
# Type this and press Tab to complete file paths
@src/com
```

This will complete to matching paths like `@src/components/` or `@src/common/`.

### Command History Completion

Access and reuse your command history efficiently:

- **Right Arrow**: Press to complete previously executed commands
- **Up Arrow**: Navigate through command history
- **Ctrl+R**: Quick search through command history

Example of history search with Ctrl+R:
```
(reverse-i-search)`git`: git commit -m "Fix login bug"
```

### Intelligent Suggestions

Forge offers contextually relevant suggestions based on your current task and recent commands, helping you work more efficiently.

## WYSIWYG Shell Experience

Enhance your interactive shell experience with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) integration:

### Rich Command Visualization

Forge visualizes each command executed with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal.

### Benefits of WYSIWYG Shell

- **Visual Clarity**: Clearly distinguishes commands from their outputs
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code and command syntax are highlighted for better readability
- **Error Highlighting**: Errors are visually distinct from successful operations
- **Improved Readability**: Complex outputs are formatted for easier comprehension

### Example WYSIWYG Experience

When you ask Forge to list files in a directory, you'll see something like:

```bash
# This is what you'll see in the terminal
$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  6 user  staff   192 Mar 15 14:22 .
drwxr-xr-x  8 user  staff   256 Mar 10 09:31 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  1420 Mar 15 14:22 index.js
drwxr-xr-x  4 user  staff   128 Mar 12 11:46 node_modules
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   514 Mar 12 11:46 package.json
drwxr-xr-x  4 user  staff   128 Mar 15 13:58 src
```

The command and its output are shown exactly as they would appear if you had typed the command yourself, making it easier to understand what's happening.

## Command Interruption

Stay in control of your shell environment with intuitive command handling:

### Canceling Operations

**Cancel with `CTRL+C`:** Gracefully interrupt ongoing operations, providing the flexibility to halt processes that no longer need execution.

### Exiting Forge

**Exit with `CTRL+D`:** Easily exit the shell session without hassle.
