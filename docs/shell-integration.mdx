# Shell Integration Features

Forge provides several features that enhance your shell experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. This section covers key shell integration features including autocomplete, WYSIWYG shell experience, and command interruption.

## Autocomplete

Boost your productivity with Forge's intelligent command completion features:

### File and Path Completion

Type `@` followed by a partial path and press Tab to get contextual file/path completion:

```bash
# Type this and press Tab to complete file paths
@src/com
```

This will complete to matching paths like `@src/components/` or `@src/common/`.

### Command History Completion

Access and reuse your command history efficiently:

- **Right Arrow**: Press to complete previously executed commands
- **Up Arrow**: Navigate through command history
- **Ctrl+R**: Quick search through command history

Example of history search with Ctrl+R:

```
(reverse-i-search)`git`: git commit -m "Fix login bug"
```

## WYSIWYG Shell Experience

Forge visualizes each command executed, complete with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal. This feature ensures clarity and enhances interaction, making every command visible in rich detail.

## Command Interruption

Stay in control of your shell environment with intuitive command handling:

### Canceling Operations

**Cancel with `CTRL+C`:** Gracefully interrupt ongoing operations, providing the flexibility to halt processes that no longer need execution.

### Exiting Forge

**Exit with `CTRL+D`:** Easily exit the shell session without hassle.
